## Introduction

This contains a customized Shopify theme designed for Haiti Coffee Co. as part of a capstone project for the UW Information School.

Much of the documentation for how you can customize the storefront can be found at the following link: https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/using-themes/change-the-layout/documentation

The page at the link below details some of Shopify's global variables and variables available on specific pages. These are vital for understanding how a Shopify theme works.

A modern Shopify theme is built up using templates. These templates are then built using sections. Sections use variables, built using the {% Schema %} tag in the section, that are input by the store owner in the Shopify console. This can be anything from a number, to a block of text, to an image. For now, the home page has sections that can be moved around through the console but other sections you can only move the section around by editing the templates code. In the future, it may be possible to move the location of a section on a template page through the console instead of editing the code, but not at this point.
